With this app users will be able to click a genre selector and song number selector from dropdown menus then hit search to return a list of randomly selected songs from Spotify Public API in the page below. Users will be able to navigate to the 'Lyrics' tab and be able to type song titles for song lyircs after they have discovered new music using our random playlist generator.

### Project Launch (https://kcjhill1234.github.io/musicdiscovery/)

### Why we created this project
The reasoning for this was to create a simple application that will generate a small playlist of randomly selected songs that is easy and uses the large Spotify DB to increase exposure to new areas of music that wouldnt normally be reached. 

### Features
Most playlist generator algorithms in apps like Spotify and Apple Music generate music lists based off of user listening history and it limits what you hear to songs that are 'like' the previous. Using randomly generated numbers to produce random tracks in all scopes of the genre is something that is hard to get and thats why we created this app. The app will also allow users to look up track lyrics easily in the same app.

### Tech

- [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js)
- [Bulma CSS Framework](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.8.0/css/bulma.css)
- [Genius Public API](https://api.genius.com)
    - added this so users can find lyrics within our app and not have to open a new page.
- [Spotify Public API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
    - we used this API because of its massive catalog of music tracks

### From Here
After this project trial and error, definitely want to add more search parameters for the playlist generator (release date, album info). Also would like to get this app to actually work.
